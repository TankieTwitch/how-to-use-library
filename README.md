# LIBRARY GUIDE

## How to use The Icon Library Project Resource

This is a brief tutorial on how to use the libraries with your server

1. Download the library of your choice and keep it in a separate area on your computer. You will replace this folder every time that library is updated. I recommend using GitHub for Desktop so you can fork the directory and use fetch anytime I update the folders. It's fast and easy and if you aren't familiar with GitHub I recommend Youtube!
2. Add the image you want to use to your server image folder OR the script folder if that is where the image files you wish to replace are located.
3. Name the icon image so it correspond to the image you are replacing or the name you have entered in the database you are adding them to - the .png name MUST match the name of the item in your script and database (I'm not a code person, but I know it is case sensitive so make sure they match)

> [!NOTE]
> Updates will include changelogs so if you are using a current image and it's updated in the library by name - this won't affect your scrips as long as you are not pulling _**directly**_ from the main library folder on your computer. Please don't do that.

* The Icon Library Project's **Discord Updates Channel** will list all the files added to the libraries and changelog if there are any.
* If there is an image update, you can decide if you want to replace the old image by dragging a copy into your server image folder or script location and renaming it.

# REDM RESOURCE ICONS
<br/>

**RedM** - has nearly 2400 individual images (at last count). The RedM folder is one large library. I have tried to organize the images by names so folder searching will be simplified. 

> [!CAUTION]
> The names of .pngs in the library can change without warning. File naming is based on my system. Best practice is to save a copy of the library on you desktop. IF an images gets updated it will be indicated in the changelog notes.
